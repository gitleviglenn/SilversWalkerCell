# SilversWalkerCell
contains scripts used in the analysis for the 2020 paper on the Walker Circulation

the manuscript has been written useing LaTeX.  much of the analysis has been done with 
matlab.   matlab (R2019b) was used to create some of the figures, ncl (NCAR command language) was 
used to create the rest.  

all experiments were performed on the gaea computer at oak ridge national laboratory use a 
modified version of the climate model AM4.0 from NOAA's GFDL.  

these scripts are here for reference.  to use them the data files are needed, and the 
paths to the data would need to be changed appropriately.
